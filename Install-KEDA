1. Installing KEDA
Below are the various options which can be used to install KEDA on Kubernetes Cluster.

Helm charts
Operator Hub
YAML declarations
Here, we will use Helm Chart to deploy KEDA.

1.1 Add Keda Core Repo to Helm: First, we will add the kedacore repository to our Helm instance by executing the below command.

helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts
1.2 Update Helm repo: Then, let’s fetch the information on the new kedacore repo that we added above:

helm repo update
1.3 Install keda Helm chart: Finally, we need to create a namespace for KEDA and install kedacore using Helm chart:

kubectl create namespace keda
helm install keda kedacore/keda --namespace keda
Once the installation is successful, let’s verify whether the keda pods are up and running by executing the below command.

kubectl get deploy,crd -n keda

keda pods status
As we can see above in the image the keda pods are up and running.
